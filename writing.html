<p class="margin:2:bottom">
	A lens into my brain existing in a liminal space somewhere between a blog and stream of conciousness. Here be
	half-finished thoughts, freshly baked posts, and underwatered notes. Change will happen, updates are inevitable.

<strong>How these posts work</strong>
<ul>
	<li>🌧 - This post is still in the early stages. Beware - here be mental dragons!</li>
	<li>🌱 - This post is growing. The basic thoughts are here, but they haven't been fully fleshed out.</li>
	<li>💐 - This post is in bloom. It's fleshed out and unlikely to change.</li>
	<li>🥀 - This post is wilting. The ideas here don't represent my current thought process.</li>
</ul>
