title: Migrating from create-react-app to Vite
description: Super-charging out frontend development and builds with vite!

Recently, I've been noticing some massive slowdowns in our frontend dev server with
create-react-app. As [our application](https://getagora.com) has grown, the time it takes
to run our server through the esoteric `react-scripts` has gotten worse and worse.
To top it all off, lately my local dev server has been crashing with a Javascript OOM error.

I've always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with Create React App - I think it's a good way to get an app started, but as you
start developing more robust React applications, you often have to hack a configuration together with tools like craco. That works
for a while, but eventually you run into performance problems. At that point, your options are ejecting and dealing with Webpack and 
  the complicated configs there, or finding an alternative.

  Not wanting to deal with Webpack and the ejected configs, I started looking for solutions.

## Vite to the rescue

Pretty quickly I discovered [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). The minimal configuration really appealed to me and I started diving into the library.
I identified a couple things we would need to handle:

1. Replace the base create-react-app configuration
2. Replace our custom `craco` tooling
3. Get jest working (or find something new)
4. Consolidate some of the "hacks" we'd done around CRA and `craco`

## Replacing create-react-app

The first step here was to remove `react-scripts` and moving things into the configuration Vite was expecting. 

I started by install the `vite` package (`yarn add -D vite`) and updating `package.json`:

```diff
   "dependencies": {
-    "@agora/craco-config": "workspace:*",
-    "@craco/craco": "7.1.0",
-    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
   },
   "scripts": {
-    "build": "craco build",
+    "build": "vite build",
-    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
-    "start": "craco start --max-old-space-size=8192",
+    "start": "vite",
-    "test": "TZ=GMT craco test",
   },
   "devDependencies": {
-    "@babel/core": "^7.17.5",
-    "@babel/helper-builder-react-jsx-experimental": "^7.12.11",
-    "@types/jest": "^29.0.0",
-    "@types/progress-bar-webpack-plugin": "^2",
-    "progress-bar-webpack-plugin": "^2.1.0",
   }
 }
```

I remove the `craco` specific tools we were using and replaced the `start` and `build` scripts with Vite.

Next, I set up `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  base: mode === 'production' ? '/public/' : '',
  build: {
    outDir: 'build',
    assetsDir: 'static',
  },
}));
```

This gets our build into the same basic shape as what create-react-app was exporting. We have some tooling in production that caches 
files in a certain directory (`/public/static`), so I wanted to keep things aligned with what was working there. If you don't have something
similar, you can just keep the default `base` and `build` configuration (just know that Vite will output to `dist` and not `build` like create-react-app does)

Now we have a simple vite config, but this won't work with our app just yet. To get the next bit up and running, we need to install `@vitejs/plugin-react`
and update the config:

```typescript line=3
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  base: mode === 'production' ? '/public/' : '',
  build: {
    outDir: 'build',
    assetsDir: 'static',
  },
}));
```
