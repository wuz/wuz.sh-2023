**This post isn't 100% finished, but I wanted to share what I do have. Check back for more updates or [follow me on bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/skeet.computer) to keep up with updates!**

I've been running the [TTRPG Folks](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:iuk433sj23ncu2oo2pfnw7fw/feed/aaabotewjkiv4) feed on Bluesky for a little bit now, and I've made 
some changes to the basic [feed generator](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) 
provided by the atproto devs.

# Starting on skyfeed

Initially, I started out building the TTRPG folks feed in [skyfeed](https://skyfeed.app). It was a pretty basic 
regex feed that used a couple little hacks to make things a bit nicer.

Here is the full regex I started with, but we'll break it down a little bit to cover the hacks.

```js
// The regex
\b#?(ttrpg|d&d|dnd|pathfinder|dungeons\s*and\s*dragons|mork\s*borg|blades\s*in\s*the\s*dark|urban\s*shadows|symbaroum|shadowdark)\b
```

## Hack 1: Using word boundaries

If you aren't super familiar with regex, there might be a few confusing aspects to the above code. First, the `\b` 
at the start and end of the regex &mdash; these are called word boundaries. They essentially match any number of ways
that a word might be wrapped in a sentence or paragraph. They are considered "anchors" that basically say "does the
following regex exist as a self contained string?".

That means we can match all sorts of things, like these examples:

```txt /Dungeons and Dragons/
Just played a game of Dungeons and Dragons.
```
```txt /D&D/
D&D is one of my favorite games!
```
```txt /TTRPG/
I love being subscribed to the TTRPG Folks feed!
```

## Hack 2: Optionally match a hashtag

The next little hack is at the beginning of the regex, where you see `#?`. This optionally matches a hashtag
letting us match things like these:

```txt /#ttrpg/
This is a hashtag with #ttrpg
```
```txt /ttrpg/
This one doesn't have a hashtag with ttrpg
```

Together with the next hack, this lets us match any words in the main regex regardless of if they are used in a 
hashtag or not.

## Hack 3: Optional spaces

Finally, each word in the regex is spaced with the `\s*`, instead of an actual `" "` character. The means we can
match any number of white spaces between the words so all of these are considered the same:

```txt /dungeons and dragons/
dungeons and dragons
```
```txt /dungeonsanddragons/
dungeonsanddragons
```
```txt /#dungeonsanddragons/
#dungeonsanddragons
```
```txt /#DungeonsAndDragons/
#DungeonsAndDragons
```
```txt /dungeons  and  dragons/
dungeons  and  dragons
```

Combining this with case insensitivity, we can match pretty much any combination of terms folks might use.

# A good start, but not exactly what I wanted

In addition to a small outage from skyfeed that took down a _ton_ of feeds on bsky, this regex wasn't able
to do some of the more complex stuff I wanted from the feed. I knew I wanted to eventually move to using
the "official" feed generator codebase.
