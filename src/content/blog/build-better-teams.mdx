title: Build better teams
description: In search of a holistic team framework

I've been on a lot of teams over my career and despite some small differences,
each one has, largely, dealt with the same challenges. Since becoming a manager
I've spent a lot more time thinking about team composition, reading books on
management and team dynamics, and generally growing a "unified theory of teams".

There have been a few books that have solidified my thinking on this topic,
and I wanted to synthesize some of the biggest take aways I've gleaned from
my experience and from those books.

## An Elegant Puzzle

To start out, I want to pull a bit of information from one of the best books on
engineering management I've ever read - An Elegant Puzzle by Will Larson. This book
covers many topics and provides concrete, actionable guidelines for
all sorts of things. Specific to teams, there are a few things that will act as
good "lane bumpers" for this framework of building better teams.

### Team Size

### Team State

## Smarter, Faster, Better

## Do Better Work

## Team Topologies
